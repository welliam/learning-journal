    'body': "Today I learned about inheritance and the super builtin in Python. I also learned about static and class methods and how and when they're useful. Also, I learned about pytest fixtures; we had already seen them in parametrize but we learned about them in general this morning. In the after I implemented a doubly linked list and worked on the HTTP server. Using exception handling as liberally as in Python doesn't come naturally to me, so I tried to get used to it when I was verifying requests in the HTTP server."

    'body': "Today we learned about concurrency in Python. There are a number of different libraries in Python that allow for some form of threading or concurrency, including some third party ones. There are even a number of libraries that specifically target concurrency in networking with different approaches. Today my partner and I adapted our web server to use gevent, but I'm also interested in learning twisted and possibly some other libraries. I know stateless programming is ideal for concurrency, so going forward I will try to practice pure programming where it makes sense. It feels to me like Python tends to rely more heavily on mutability, so I'm thinking I'll run into situations where the Pythonic approach may conflict with writing pure code."

    'body': "Today we worked on a solo and group challenge. Both went well; the group challenge was a problem I had already read about (and another member had finished). After that I worked on finishing up the HTTP server with my partner. Having finished it I want to try writing one again in Python, or maybe another language, to see if I can design it better."

    'body': "Today I worked on converting this website to work with Pyramid, and deploying it to Heroku. Additionally, my partner and I worked on implementing a deque, which was straightforward using composition with our existing doubly linked list implementation. However, because we had some problems with it in the past we payed special attention to testing this implementation."

    'body': "Today we wrote a binary heap and worked on our learning journals. The binary heap threw me for a loop when I thought I found a strange simplification, but just recently I broke it with tests and reverted it to its (proper) self, from a corner case I just thought of. We covered HTML templating today during lecture through jinja2."
